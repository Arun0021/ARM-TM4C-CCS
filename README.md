# ARM-TM4C-CCS
This repository contains all my practice codes of TM4C123GXL coded in CCS7. 
The Texas Instruments Tiva C LaunchPad board TM4C123G is used for the code. 
The TM4C123GXL Launchpad has the TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller which is based on the ARM Cortex-M4F 
microcontroller architecture and clocked at 80 MHz (with 100 DMIPS)
